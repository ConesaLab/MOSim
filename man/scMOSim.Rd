\usage{
scMOSim(omics, cellTypes, numberCells = NULL, mean = NULL, sd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{omics}{named list containing the omic to simulate as names, which can 
be "scRNA-seq" or "scATAC-seq".}

\item{cellTypes}{list where the i-th element of the list contains the column 
indices for i-th experimental conditions. List must be a named list.}

\item{numberCells}{vector of numbers. The numbers correspond to the number of 
cells the user wants to simulate per each cell type. The length of the 
    vector must be the same as length of \code{cellTypes}.}

\item{mean}{vector of numbers of mean per each cell type. Must be specified 
just if \code{numberCells} is specified.The length of the vector must be 
    the same as length of \code{cellTypes}.}

\item{sd}{vector of numbers of standard deviation per each cell type. Must be 
specified just if \code{numberCells} is specified.The length of the vector 
    must be the same as length of \code{cellTypes}.}
}
\value{
a list of Seurat object, one per each omic.
}
\description{
Performs multiomic simulation of single cell datasets
}
\examples{

cellTypes <- list(cellA = c(1:20), cellB = c(161:191))
sim <- scMOSim(omicsList, cellTypes)
# or
sim_with_arg <- scMOSim(omicsList, cellTypes, numberCells = c(10,20),
      mean = c(2000000, 100000), sd = c(10^3, 10^3))
