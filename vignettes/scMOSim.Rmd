# 1. Introduction

`scMOSim` is an extension of `MOSim` for the multi-omic simulation of
single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq data. This vignette
contains a step by step guide on how to use `scMOSim` basic functions.

`scMOSim` lets the user simulate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq count matrices
starting from either:

-   The multiomics pbmc dataset from `SeuratData` library loaded by the
    package.
-   A real count matrix or Seurat object provided by the user.

`scMOSim` also allows the user to simulate biological replicates and
different experimental conditions, starting from the original count
matrix and simulating variabilities on top as well as differentially
expressed genes between experimental conditions.

To indicate the relationship between the main omic (scRNA-seq) and the
regulatory omic (scATAC-seq), `scMOSim` follows a similar approach to
the original `MOSim` approach. It simulates gene coexpression in
clusters and defines regulatory effects of the regulator omic on the
scRNA-seq (activator, repressor or no effect).

# 2. Getting started

`scMOSim` may be loaded by installing the `MOSim` package as:

```{r install mosim, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    
BiocManager::install("MOSim")
```

The current development version may be installed as follows:

```{r install mosim from github, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ConesaLab/MOSim")
```

# 3. Data preparation

The function `sc_omicData` was designed to help the user to provide its
own data and set it in a compatible format with the function `scMOSim`,
it takes as input:

-   `omics_types`, a list of strings which can be either "scRNA-seq" or
    "scATAC-seq", or the two together.

-   `data` if passed, its a user inputted list of matrices with features
    as rows and cells as columns. If data is NULL, the default data from
    the `SeuratData` package will be used.

## 3.1 Provided PBMC dataset from `SeuratData` package

`scMOSim` allows the user to simulate scRNA and scATAC count data
resembling the characteristics of the multiomics PBMC dataset (from a
healthy donor) available from `SeuratData`. This dataset was subset for
computational cost reasons; the count data loaded automatically is
available only for CD4 TEM, cDC, Memory_B and Treg cells.

CD4 TEM cells represent the first 298 cells (columns) of the matrix; cDC
the next 197; Memory B the next 370; and Treg the final 161 cells.

As an example, we take both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data provided in
the package. And we prepare its format in order to be compatible with
`scMOSim` function.

```{r count matrix uploaded in the package}

omic_list <- sc_omicData(list("scRNA-seq", "scATAC-seq"))

```

The resulting `omic_list` is a named list having omics' names as names
and count matrices as value. It will be one of the arguments used as
input for function `scMOSim`.

## 3.2 Providing custom data: count matrix or `Seurat` object

`scMOSim` also allows the user to simulate scRNA and scATAC count data
resembling the characteristics of a dataset of their choice. To do so,
it first requires `sc_omicData` to format the data provided by the user.
The supported input formats are:

-   Count matrix
-   Seurat object

As an example, we load a scRNA-seq count matrix loaded in the `MOSim`
package, containing 2 cell types (CellA, CellB).

The count matrix is composed of:

-   36301 genes and 46 cells (20 CellA, 26 CellB);

```{r provided by the user, eval = FALSE}
scRNA <- MOSim::sc_omicData("scRNA-seq")
count <- scRNA[["scRNA-seq"]]
options(Seurat.object.assay.version = "v3")
Seurat_obj <- Seurat::CreateAssayObject(counts = count, assay = 'RNA')
omic_list_user <- sc_omicData(c("scRNA-seq"), c(Seurat_obj))
```

The resulting `omic_list_user` is a named list having "scRNA-seq" as
name and the example count matrix as values.

# 4. Running the simulation: `scMOSim`

## 4.1 Default `scMOSim` simulation

`scMOSim` gives the user the opportunity to simulate scRNA and scATAC
count matrices which resemble the characteristics of the input data (or
that loaded by default), without providing further arguments, as
follows:

`scMOSim(omic_list, cellTypes)`

`scMOSim`, in case of not providing any optional arguments, requires as
input an omics list and a cell type list.

```{r simulation, message=FALSE}
cell_types <- list('CD4_TEM' = c(1:298), 'cDC' = c(299:496), 'Memory_B' = c(497:867), 
                   'Treg' = c(868:1029))

sim <- scMOSim(omic_list, cell_types)
```

`sim` is a named list having 'sim_sc + omic name' as names and `Seurat`
objects as values (where the synthetic count matrices are contained).
The simulated count matrices are raw (i.e. not normalized) count tables,
having genes/peaks on rows and cells on columns, containing read/UMI
count values.

Assuming the data produced in [Section 2.1](#2.1) is being used, running
the code above, `scMOSim` simulates scRNAseq and scATACseq count
matrices, resulting in matrices with the following characteristics:

-   36601 genes and 1029 cells;
-   108377 peaks and 1029 cells;
-   4 cell types CD4_TEM, cDC, Memory_B and Treg each matrix;
-   cell type CD4_TEM has 298 cells;
-   cell type cDC has 197 cells;
-   cell type Memory_B has 370 cells;
-   cell type Treg has 161 cells.

## 4.2 Optional settings for `scMOSim` simulation

The main arguments accepted by `scMOSim` function to customize the
simulation are:

-   `omics` named list containing the omic to simulate as names, which
    can be "scRNA-seq" or "scATAC-seq".

-   `cellTypes` list where the i-th element of the list contains the
    column indices for i-th experimental conditions.

-   `numberReps` OPTIONAL. Number of biological replicates to simulate
    per group.

-   `numberGroups` OPTIONAL. Number of different biological groups to
    simulate.

-   `diffGenes` OPTIONAL. If number groups \> 1, DE genes to simulate.
    List of vectors (one per group to compare to group 1) where the
    vector contains absolute number of genes for Up and Down ex: c(250,

    500) or a percentage for up, down ex: c(0.2, 0.2). The rest will be
         NE.

-   `minFC` OPTIONAL. Threshold of FC below which genes are
    downregulated compared to group 1. By default 0.25.

-   `maxFC` OPTIONAL. Threshold of FC above which genes are upregulated
    compared to group 1. By default 4.

-   `numberCells` OPTIONAL. Vector of numbers. The numbers correspond to
    the number of cells the user wants to simulate per each cell type.
    The length of the vector must be the same as length of `cellTypes`.

-   `mean` OPTIONAL. Vector of numbers of mean expression per each cell
    type. Must be specified only if `sd` is specified.The length of the
    vector must be the same as length of `cellTypes`.

-   `sd` OPTIONAL. Vector of numbers of standard deviation of expression
    per each cell type. Must be specified only if `mean` is specified.
    The length of the vector must be the same as length of `cellTypes`.

-   `noiseRep` OPTIONAL. Number indicating the desired standard
    deviation between biological replicates. By default 0.1.

-   `noiseGroup` OPTIONAL. Number indicating the desired standard
    deviation between groups. By default 0.4.

-   `feature_no` OPTIONAL. Total number of features to be distributed
    between coexpression clusters. By default 8000.

-   `clusters` OPTIONAL. Number of co-expression patterns to simulate.
    By default 8.

-   `cluster_size` OPTIONAL. Number of features to include in each
    co-simulation cluster. By default (recommended), its the number of
    features `feature_no` divided by the number of patterns `clusters`
    to generate.

For example, if the user wants to generate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
datasets of 4 celltypes, with c(10, 20, 30, 40) cells per celltype, 2
biological replicates and 2 groups, with 20% upregulated DE genes and
30% downregulated DE genes between groups, 8000 co-expressed genes split
into 8 cluster patterns and a defined mean and standard deviation
expression per celltype, the call to scMOSim would be as follows:

```{r simulation with optional arguments, message=FALSE}
omic_list <- sc_omicData(c("scRNA-seq", "scATAC-seq"))
cell_types <- list('CD4_TEM' = c(1:60), 'cDC' = c(299:310), 'Memory_B' = c(497:520), 'Treg' = 
                     c(868:900))
sim <- scMOSim(omic_list, cell_types, numberCells = c(10, 20, 30, 40), numberReps = 2, 
               numberGroups = 2, diffGenes = list(c(0.2, 0.3)), feature_no = 8000, 
               clusters = 8, mean = c(2*10^6, 1*10^6,2*10^6, 1*10^6), 
               sd = c(5*10^5, 2*10^5, 5*10^5, 2*10^5))
```

The result count matrices will have:

-   36601 genes and 100 cells;
-   108377 peaks and 100 cells;
-   4 cell types CD4_TEM, cDC, Memory_B and Treg each matrix;
-   cell type CD4_TEM has 10 cells, with an average library size of 2M
    reads and sd of 500K;
-   cell type cDC has 30 cells, with an average library size of 1M reads
    and sd of 200k;
-   cell type Memory_B has 10 cells, with an average library size of 2M
    reads and sd of 500K;
-   cell type Treg has 30 cells, with an average library size of 1M
    reads and sd of 200k.

# 5. Multi-omic integration: `sc_omicInt`

## 5.1 Default `sc_omicInt` integration

`MOSim` can also define the regulatory function (activator, repressor,
or no effect) of features in the regulatory omics data, i.e. the peaks
in scATAC-seq, without providing the optional arguments. It's mandatory
that the simulation would include both the central data type and the
regulatory one. The single-cell multi-omic integration, goes as follows:

`sc_integration <- sc_omicSim(sim, cellTypes, totalFeatures = NULL, regulatorEffect = NULL, associationList = NULL)`

The association list loaded into the package is a dataframe with two
columns (Peak_ID and Gene_name) retrieved from Human Genome 19. Assuming
the data produced in [Section 3.1](#3.1) is being used, scRNAseq and
scATACseq count matrices will be simulated, resulting in matrices with
the following characteristics:

```{r integration with no optional arguments, echo = FALSE}
# cell_types_integration <- list(cellA = c(1:20), cellB = c(21:40), cellC =c(41:55), cellD=c(56:70))
# sc_integration <- sc_omicInt(sim = sim, cellTypes = cell_types_integration)
```

`sc_integration` is a named list reporting the markers and their
regulatory functions between every couple of cell types. Peak_id,
activity and cell type is the data reported in the list.

```{r printing markers cell A cell B}
# sc_integration[["markers_cellA_cellB"]][1061:1090,] 
```

## 5.2 Optional settings for `sc_omicInt` integration

In case the user wants to have a custom amount of features, obtaining a
custom amount of features for each type of activity and passing an
association list of their choice, it's possible to use the optional
arguments. In the following example the association list loaded in the
package will still be used.

```{r integration with optional arguments, echo = FALSE}
# cell_types_integration <- list(cellA = c(1:20), cellB = c(21:40), cellC =c(41:55), cellD=c(56:70))
# regulator_effect <- list('activator' = 0.8,'repressor' = 0.1,'NE' = 0.1)
# sc_integration_with_arg <- sc_omicInt(sim = sim, cellTypes = cell_types_integration, totalFeatures = 1000, regulatorEffect = regulator_effect)
```

`sc_integration_with_arg` is a named list reporting the markers and
their regulatory functions between every couple of cell types. Peak_id,
activity and cell type is the data reported in the list. The markers and
their regulatory functions between every pair of cell types were
identified using a subset of 1,000 features, which is smaller than the
10,000 features used in `sc_integration`. Among these features, those
with 'activator' function were reduced to 80%, while those with
'repressor' or 'no effect' function were reduced to 10% each.

```{r printing markers cell A cell B for sc_integration_with_arg}
# sc_integration_with_arg[["markers_cellA_cellB_subset"]][1:20,] 
```

# 6. Working with simulation results

## 6.1 The `scMOSim` *simulation* object

## 6.2 Retrieving the simulation settings

## 6.3 Accessing the count data matrices

# 7. Example full run

Let's run a full experiment and plot some interesting facts.

```{r sim, eval = FALSE}
omic_list <- sc_omicData(c("scRNA-seq", "scATAC-seq"))
cell_types <- list('CD4_TEM' = c(1:60), 'cDC' = c(299:310), 'Memory_B' = c(497:520), 'Treg' = 
                     c(868:900))
sim <- scMOSim(omic_list, cell_types, numberCells = c(10, 20, 30, 40), numberReps = 2, 
               numberGroups = 2, diffGenes = list(c(0.2, 0.3)), feature_no = 8000, 
               clusters = 8, mean = c(2*10^6, 1*10^6,2*10^6, 1*10^6), 
               sd = c(5*10^5, 2*10^5, 5*10^5, 2*10^5), 
               regulatorEffect = list(c(0.2, 0.1), c(0.1, 0.3)))
```

Plotting the simulated clusters for scRNAseq data of Replicate sample 1
of Group 2

```{r plot clusters RNA, eval = TRUE}
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())
# Scale isoforms to show the clustering patterns
coexpr.scaled <- acorde::scale_isoforms(sim$Group_2$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`@assays$RNA@counts, 
                                isoform_col = NULL)
# fillna
coexpr.scaled[is.na(coexpr.scaled)] <- 0

# create cell-to-cell-type ID table
ct <- tibble::tibble(Cell = colnames(sim$Group_2$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`@assays$RNA@counts),
                            cell_type = rep(names(cell_types), times = lengths(cell_types)))

# compute average-by-cell type cluster patterns
cluster_patterns <- map(sim$Clusters_list$`Clusters_scRNA-seq`,
                    ~acorde::calculate_cluster_profile(coexpr.scaled,
                                               isoform_ids = .,
                                               id_table = ct,
                                               isoform_col = "transcript"))

pattern_plots <- map(cluster_patterns,
                     plot_cluster_profile,
                     ct_labels = c("CD4_TEM", "cDC", "Memory_B", "Treg"))

# Plot the clusters
plot_grid(plotlist = pattern_plots, 
          labels = NULL, 
          ncol = 4)
```

We can do the same with the ATAC data:

```{r plot clusters ATAC}
coexpr.scaledATAC <- acorde::scale_isoforms(sim$Group_2$Rep_1$`sim_scATAC-seq`@assays$ATAC@counts, isoform_col = NULL)

coexpr.scaledATAC[is.na(coexpr.scaledATAC)] <- 0

# create cell-to-cell-type ID table
ctATAC <- tibble::tibble(Cell = colnames(sim$Group_2$Rep_1$`sim_scATAC-seq`@assays$ATAC@counts),
                            cell_type = rep(names(cell_types), times = lengths(cell_types)))

# compute average-by-cell type cluster patterns
cluster_patternsATAC <- map(sim$Clusters_list$`Clusters_scATAC-seq`,
                    ~acorde::calculate_cluster_profile(coexpr.scaledATAC,
                                               isoform_ids = .,
                                               id_table = ctATAC,
                                               isoform_col = "transcript"))


## Select only the clusters that don't have NAs


pattern_plotsATAC <- map(cluster_patternsATAC,
                     acorde::plot_cluster_profile,
                     ct_labels = c("CD4_TEM", "cDC", "Memory_B", "Treg"))

plot_grid(plotlist = pattern_plotsATAC, 
          labels = NULL, 
          ncol = 4)
```

Back to the simulated scRNA-seq. Plot the number of features in the
sample, and the counts per feature.

```{r plot violins}
VlnPlot(sim$Group_2$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA"), ncol = 2)
```

Add metadata to the Seurat objects to be able to plot samples together,
log transform and plot the variable features:

```{r metadata}
sim$Group_1$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq` <- Seurat::AddMetaData(sim$Group_1$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`, list("Group" = rep("Group_1", length(colnames(sim$Group_1$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`))), "Rep" = rep("Rep_1", length(colnames(sim$Group_1$Rep_1$`sim_scRNA-seq`)))))
